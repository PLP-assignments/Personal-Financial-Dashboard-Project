## Why Now:
The current economic landscape, characterized by rapid technological advancements and changing financial behaviors, underscores the need for individuals to have better control over their finances. With the prevalence of digital platforms and the growing trend towards self-management of finances, now is the opportune moment to develop a personal financial tracker that caters to the evolving needs of users.
